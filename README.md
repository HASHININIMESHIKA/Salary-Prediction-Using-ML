# Streamlit Web Developer Salary Prediction

## Overview
This project is a web application developed using Streamlit, which predicts the annual salary of software developers based on various features like country, education level, and years of professional experience. The application leverages machine learning models to provide accurate salary predictions and includes a comparison page to evaluate the performance of different models.

## Features
- **Salary Prediction**: Predict the annual salary of software developers based on user input.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize and understand the underlying data used for predictions.
- **Model Comparison**: Compare the performance of different machine learning models using metrics such as Mean Squared Error and R-Squared.

## Project Structure
- **app.py**: The main entry point of the application.
- **predict_page.py**: Contains the code for the salary prediction page.
- **visualization_page.py**: Includes data visualization elements.
- **comparison_page.py**: Houses the logic for comparing different machine learning models.
- **survey_results_public.csv**: The dataset used for training and predictions.
- **requirements.txt**: Contains the necessary Python packages to run the application.
